# ✨ Hello there! ✨

- 🎓 I’m currently a university student, but I won’t mention the name of it because, honestly, I’m disappointed with it. 😅  
- 💻 I’ve learned C/C++ at a basic level and spent quite a bit of time on Java and the Spring Framework.  
- 😩 At the moment, I feel completely burned out with programming—it’s been overwhelming lately.  
- 🛌 My favorite hobby is sleeping now, as my love for FPS games was wiped out during university entrance exam prep. 🎮🚫  

- 📝 That’s all for now!
