# ✨ Yo, what's up? ✨

- 🎓 Yeah, I’m a university student, but don’t even bother asking where—I hate that place, it sucks. 😤  
- 💻 I’ve barely scraped by with C/C++ and wasted a ton of time trying to get into Java and the Spring Framework. Honestly, it’s been a f***ing headache.  
- 😩 Right now? I’m so fed up with programming, I wanna throw my laptop out the window.  
- 🛌 My only "hobby" now is sleeping, 'cause my FPS gaming days died a miserable death thanks to that damn university entrance exam grind. 💤🎮💔  

- 📝 That’s it. Don’t expect much more. ✌️
